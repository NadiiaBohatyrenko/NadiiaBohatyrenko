I am ukrainian and due to the war in Ukraine I should move to Germany with my kids. I have almost 10-years experience in civil aviation and was working in the airport Boryspil (Kyiv). Unfortunately all airports in Ukraine do not operate now and lots of employees lost the jobs. I can not continue to work in the airport here in Munich due to the necessary security check of all employees who works in aviation. So that why I start looking for the possibilities how to survive in foreign country. Fortunately I have heard about the ReDI school which provides a great possibility to cover a new qualification and it is free of charge. So I am going to do my best during this course).
